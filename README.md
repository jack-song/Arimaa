Open source contributions welcome! I'm currently looking for someone to pass on the development torch; there's a lot of interesting work to be done, especially as a beginner/intermediate project. Send an email to jackthesong@gmail.com and I'd be glad to set you up/do a walkthrough.

#### In progress:
  - stricter implementation of game rules (corner/rare cases)

#### TODO:
  - Exporting utility methods from the massive GameEngine class to a game rules oriented class
  - Bots!
  - Link to learn the rules
  - Adjusting the scopes of fields and methods
  - reducing amount of switch-cases etc.
  - Implementing exceptions for handling errors
  - Add test cases
  - Defining and using constants properly
  - Exporting fields from the massive GameEngine class to a proper model class
    - implementing an observer pattern on the model class to reduce onion code layers
  - Importing and exporting games
  - Online games ???
