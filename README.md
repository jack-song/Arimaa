Currently in development as a learning project; feedback, pointers, and advice greatly appreciated

####Planned refactors:
  - Exporting utility methods from the massive GameEngine class to a game rules oriented class
  - Adjusting the scopes of fields and methods
  - reducing amount of switch-cases and other convoluted code pieces
  - Implementing exceptions for handling errors
  - Defining and using constants properly
  - Exporting fields from the massive GameEngine class to a proper model class
    - implementing an observer pattern on the model class to reduce onion code layers
  
####Planned features:
  - move generation to allow easier move-making
  
####Much later:
  - Bots
  - Importing and exporting games
  - Connecting online ???
